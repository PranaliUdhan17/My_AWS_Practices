# My_AWS_Practices
(My_AWS-Used_Services)
Hi all,

Welcome to this repository!

Here, I've shared a collection of hands-on practical notes and exercises I completed during my AWS learning journey. These notes include real-time examples, configurations, and steps that I followed while exploring various AWS services.

Feel free to explore and use them as reference for your own AWS practice.

Thank you!
